          This graphic tells a small story about bicycle traffic on the Fremont bridge in Seattle Washington through the course of 2018. It does so using a traditional graphic (a line chart), a fashionable but unusual chart (a sunburst), and novel chart type (the table cartograms nested into a treemap). The table cartogram (a visualization arising from, but considered only in passing by, the academic set) encodes tabular data through the areas of a grid while maintaining the adjacency of that grid, all while keeping everything bound within a rectangle. We make a table cartogram of each of the months in the year and them in a proportionately-sized slice-dice treemap. From this combo we are able to see a number of dimensions and granularities simultaneously: the relative popularity of travel during the weekend to the workweek, that no one rides during thanksgiving, and XYZ. The table cartogram is a close relative of the geographic cartogram (although cast into an abstract light), the popularity of summer compared to winter, and a host of small nuances.

          This work makes use of some software I wrote for my Masters thesis in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. A further write up of that library, the types of graphics that it produces, and the nature of table cartogram usage is still forthcoming. For now: this graphic was produced by combining data published by the <a href="https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k">city of Seattle</a> and historical weather data from <a href="https://darksky.net/">Darksky</a>. It makes use of a lot of custom javascript code <a href="https://github.com/mcnuttandrew/cycles-rain-seasons-in-size">(which you can view here)</a> to calculate layout and positioning, <a href="https://github.com/uber/react-vis">react-vis</a> for rendering, and sketch for visual tuning.
