# Cycles rain seasons in size

This is the source files for a small info graphic about bicycles in fremont. If you are curious about the graphic you should go [here](https://www.mcnutt.in/cycles-rain-seasons-in-size/) to read the little I wrote about it. If you are curious about the code, you can try reading src, but I warn you it is not a well kempt repo. This project was born as a side project to another side project and has the organization of a chunk of code with that type of provenance.


The data in this project is from

- Bridge counts: https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k

- Weather: https://darksky.net/forecast/47.6505,-122.35/us12/en
